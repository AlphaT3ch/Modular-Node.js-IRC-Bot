# Modular-Node.js-IRC-bot

An extremely modular IRC bot written in Node.js (early in dev)

## How to use/install

1. Open ```settings.js``` and configure the file. There are comments in the file that should tell you what to do.
2. Install Node.js. Go in a command prompt and navigate to the bot's folder.   
Type ```node main.js``` or alternatively, open ```run.bat```.   

Your bot should be on the desired channel.
