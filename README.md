# Modular-Node.js-IRC-bot

An extremely modular IRC bot written in Node.js (VERY early in development at the moment)

## How to use

1. Rename ```settings.js.example``` to ```settings.js```.
2. Open it and configure the file. There are comments in ```settings.js``` that should tell you what to do.
3. Install Node.js. Go in a command prompt and navigate to the bot's folder.   
Type ```node main.js``` or alternatively, open ```run.bat```.   
(Note: to run it on a server, you must type ```node main.js```)

Your bot should be on the desired channel.

## Modules
See ```COMMANDS.md```.
